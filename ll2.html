<h3 style="color:red;"> Dear Aishwarya </h3>
  <p>In life there are certain things that words cannot describe. The feeling I have when I talk to you, when I think about you, and when I dream about you, is amazing. I've never felt like this, before in my life. My love for you has grown so much over the past couple of months. I would have never imagined that we would be where we are today. I don't think that our love will ever fade or wither. I'll always be there for you.

<p>
Whenever I see you smile or be happy and it always makes my day
I am so glad to be loved by someone as special as you are.
Nobody could ever make me happy and win my hardened heart until I met you.

  <p>When I put all of this together, the best of life is with you. You mean more than anything in this world to me.
Every morning when I wake up the first thing hit my mind, is you.
Loving you is like an addiction to me. Before going to sleep, you are on my mind, so you are alwayz there on my mind, like alwayzzz, even in my dreams {if I have a dream} you’re there in it.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Understand that there are some things in life that are inevitable. I am powerless and cannot control those things. Yet, the sun will rise and set, the tide will continue, the seasons will continue to change and I will continue to love you.</p>
<br>
<p>
Did I ever tell you what a beautiful woman you are? When I say beautiful, it is not only the outward appearance but also your amazing personality and kind heart. I am glad you are my partner, and sometimes I wonder what I have done to have you in my life.</p>
<p>
If it wasn't for your love,
I wouldn't know what the real happiness is.
Trust me, when I say that the joy from spending time with you is simply the best thing I have ever experienced in my life.

  <p>I don't think I will ever have a reason to love you less because in you I have everything, your love is all I need,
I swear to love your as long as I live.
You are the only person who I can be myself with.
I can feel you close to me even though you're far away. Please believe me when I say I love you.
</p>
<p>
When you are with me, I can't think of anything else. Your beauty mesmerizes me and when you speak, I get that internal glee. Girl you are like a Star in my life. You brighten my day with your smile. I just want to confess it today; it's been on my mind for a while. That I truly love you my Queen. I mean it.
</p>
<p>
 A truth of life, yes that's you! You are my everything my dear, with you everything seems so new. You are my girl and I love you a lot. You are always there in my every thought. I don't know how to express my feelings for you. Whatever I will say will be true. My Queen, you are the reason why I stay so happy in life.
</p>
<p>
You are my only reason for survival. I don't think, I would be able to live a day without you. Without you it will really be difficult to stay. I will always keep loving you in my life come what may. I truly want to tell you that I love you. Thank you for being you, and for having me by your side.

<p>Something was missing in my life. I really don't know what it was. But, since the time you came in my life, I started feeling complete. Yes, that is true, I am only for you. Your presence in my life gives me a new high.
Now, that you and I are together, we shall never ever part. I just want to thank you for coming in my life. Without you my love, it's really hard to strive. I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate having you in my life. For helping me through the bad times and being there to help me celebrate the good times, I cherish all of the moments that we share together. There aren’t enough words in the dictionary for me to tell you how glad I am to have you in my life. I am so lucky to have you by my side. Everything you do for me never goes unnoticed. I don’t know what I did to deserve someone as wonderful as you, but I am eternally grateful to have your love, support, and affection.

<p>
Today, you said in Bengali, “Aami tome bhalobashi”, so “Main tenu pyaar karda”, I really like you & when you said this, I got lost in our chats, in your thoughts, in you. You’re my life Aishwarya.</p>

With all my Love,</p>

Yours foreva,</p>
