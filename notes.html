==============================================================================================================
[D'day]: Truth is !! You are the bestest gift god has ever given
to me in my life as bestest partner ever
You means a lott to me
Words are not
enough to describe you in my life
You are
my happiness so always smile in your life
when no one understand me, U did and supported me
a lot in every situation Our bonds are soo
strong that, it can't be break by anyone we
fight a lot but instead of breakup or being separate ,
we became tooo much close more than that
Many misunderstanding has came between us, bt
still we solved everything even sometimes
if i get anger that doesn't mean i m ignoring you or will
leave, my anger is nothing Infront of our love, and thats
why i won't get anger
Trust me without you
I am incomplete , you are like sugar in the teaa
A love like yours is so rare, and it would be
a shame to me if I can't realize how lucky I am to have
you
Today isn't just your special day, it's
also mine. trust me i'll be there for you whateva happens... i'll take  care of you will support you no matter what... its just an interview jo hua thik, hum saath me face krlege... you aint alone... 
I love you Aishwarya...

have filled a bit of goldmans sachs form for you
==============================================================================================================
==============================================================================================================
first when i told you go chat with your friend, it wasnt an act of possessiveness, instead it was maturity, atleast for me, coz when i say go talk to your friend, it means i'm here you can talk to friend & then come back, coz friend wont be there at 3 am, but i will... but if i would have said dont talk to friend just talk to me, toh vo possessiveness hota & maine 2 way baat ni ki... ovio i want ki call pe merese baat kro, but friend is messaging toh krlo usse baat, mai toh baad me vi call krskta hu...
then, you called me online, boli thi ki if i dont sleep, i'll chat with you, right, so i was there online, since i was missing you i opened your chat, saw you online but message ni kiya coz i thought kahi koi aur check na kr rha ho, but then you were online for about an hour & i was just waiting for your message... kuch aya ni, & then i got tired so you even said ki jb souge toh gn message krdena, i did my part...
moreover, you lied ki tum ni royi, i'm hurt but won't say anything... i just dont understand the need to lie to me... then you didnt even ate your dinner when i request ki 10 pm tk krlena, you said okay, but vo vi nii kiya for the 3rd day in the row...
fir bkws kr rhi ho you dont deserve me, & shit... & fir gyb hogyi ekdum... i called i messaged i whatsapped just no replies, i thought sogyi hogi, so i wont disturb you so vapz call ni kiya... but i dont know kaha thii...
jaate jaate bie bolgyi toh ab i dont know... 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
12.00 pm: sorry yar, i'm glad sb sort hogya & you have kept me back... thenks a lot...
12.05 pm: you need not sing a song, i know you're doing this to make me happy, but trust me i'm happy already... so even if you dont want tum na bhi sing kro its totally cool... just tum happy rho thats what i want...
12.30 pm: i miss you yar, but message ni krunga coz tumhe padai krni hai, & i dont wanna disturb you again...
12.34 pm: i started thinking how to make you happy, i thought ki atleast txt file likdeta hu, aur sochta hu kya kru to make my girl happy...

01.27 pm: i'll neva force you for anything, mat ao relation me koi issue nii hai i really trust you even more than i trust myself...
01.30 pm: this relation is to release all your stress & problems, not to give you stress sorry yar abse ni hoga i promise... abse kvi ni ldunga...
01.40 pm: please jane ke baat mat kiya kro, mai kal puri raat dara rha... darjta hu jb tum gussa hoti ho darjata hu jb vi ldyi hoti hai darjata hu mai... i guess you have seen the way i look my eyes my actions everything shows you that i dont wanna lose you no matter what...
01.50 pm: i was missing you but photo ni dekha, coz permission leni thi...  & i didnt wanted to disturb you at that time so ni bola, but i miss you a lot...
02.00 pm: please lunch by 3 pm...sorry disturb krna padega for this... 2.30 bolunga...

I miss you a lot right now at 5.45 am in morning... so I thought let's write for my Queen... avi just vapz utha tumhra dream aya chotu sa, dream was that we are together somewhere,  I asked to hug you & you allowed me, so we hugged, ab hug krke the thing is, I'll get lost in your arms & was feeling very happy... but fir sunset hua & we watched the sunset together we were holding hands at the beach & after sunset you hugged me ekdum tightly & I gently whispered in your ear "I love you Aishwarya" & you laughed... you know sunset amazing dikhta ha but when you laughed, that was next to sunset... your smile & laugh is fabulous, amazing, astonishing, gorgeous jo bolu km ha... & I got lost in that smile... I can do anything & everything for you... I'll try my best to do all household work & jo rhgaya vo maid krde & tumhe kuch kaam na krna pde... I really wanna keep you as my Queen, just the way you deserve... I was thinking about us coz neenu2open hogyi & I miss youu... yar kal tum boli "I'm calling want to listen your voice" , I fell for you yet again... firse pyaar hogya tumse... I'm sorry thodi weird ha meri voice... do you really like it? Tumhri voice toh iti achi ha it releases my stress gimme power to look over you & our careers but this is not the case with my voice sorry... but that gesture of yours yr I really like you I felt so happy that you told me to call just to be with me... coz at that time I was missing you a lot but I thought call possible nhi hogi toh I didn't asked... & tum chat krte krte sogyi it's good... sorry mat bolna you were tired & I know this... pta ha jb hum discord pe time spend kr rhe the I felt very good... If you find that some girl isn't right you can say block her or if you want you can tell m to block all I'll do it without any 2nd thoughts... I just want you... I want ki tum comfortable feel kro & no girl can Eva come in your place... I don't want tumhe jealous feel Ho,  I want my Queen to know that I'm completely hers & I belong to her only... you're my most favourite person & I wait on WhatsApp just to talk to you... you're the happiness of my life... ab tum khud Hi dekho when you say something of leaving me, it means my happiness is leaving... Please kvi vi Jane ki baat mat krna please you're the most important person of my life & I just can't afford to loose you... I just hope notes pdke tum bore na hojao...

It might involve some restrictions so.. Please try to understand my situation, I'm afraid of losing you, if I put restrictions then also you get sad, if I don't look after safety toh bhi issue ha, you're my responsibility so safety toh mai2hi dekhunga... but I can't put restrictions either.. so I get even more afraid...

I call you “Mine” because you’re my favorite person I ever have in my life, I neva met someone like you has made me smile but you also make sure that you’re alwayzzz there for me wheneva I needed someone. There has been times when I actually realize that I’m so lucky & blessed, I alwayzzz wanted to say this to you “I’m not gonna share you with anyone else” because “You’re just Mine” & I mean it because I can’t imagine losing you, I have someone whom I can share everything with, be weird with, call you as “MINE” & you always take efforts to make me happy, I know I have irritate maybe made you feel worse when we had fights went on hours without talking but still you always have been with me, neva left me & I know I’m not the best but indeed I am blessed with the best, someone who respects my tears, appreciates me for who I’m, loves me even when its not possible, listens to all my shits & still say “I love you” to remind me I’m special. I can’t ever say how special you’re to me but all I can say is I’ll neva hurt you, I’ll neva let you go. You’re just Mine now & foreva. I want to build & explore with you now.
I love you so much my Queen Aishwarya.
I’ll marry you my Queen Aishwarya.
Aishwarya Weds Ishan.
