<h3 style="color:red;"> Dear Aishwarya </h3>
  <p>My life is beautiful because of you my love, you showed me the meaning of love not with your words but with your care & efforts. I knew your shy nature doesn’t let you open up to me; but your eyes speak up the love you have for me. You entered my heart slowly & quietly. Your love spread through me. In every direction, I see only you – just you. What madness, what obsession… what can I say of my state now? My Heart, my soul, my whole world, you are my only desire. My Sweetheart only You!!! 
</p>
<br>
<p>
There are days when I lie in bed, consumed by thoughts of you, the way your eyes light up when you smile, the way your lips curve, how when you hug me close I can smell the freshness of your skin & it envelopes me this warmth which makes me feel secure & makes me feel like I belong. I may not be able to tell you enough just how much you mean to me, so today I want to tell you in letters that having you walk into my life is probably the best thing that could have eva happened to me…</p>
<p> 
<br>
I can be myself when I’m with you, your idea of romance is dim lights, some food & just the two of us… you make me feel like I have neva felt before, I can tell you anything & you won’t judge me. You & I together we can make magic. We’re a prefect match. Thinking of you fills me with a wonderful feeling.  Your love gives me the feeling t hat the best is still ahead {our marriage our family}.

You neva give upon me & that what keeps me going. I love you because you bring the best out of me. You always say what I need to hear. You have taught me the true meaning of Love.

I love you my Queen Aishwarya. I want to keep us happy now. I’ll do anything for us, just for a smile on your face.

  <p>
The last time we met, while I was feeding you with my hands, that feeling I just cant put into words, but how good it was I guess you understand with this, wheneva I think of feeding you, I just close my eyes feel you are there right beside me & start feeding you with my hands… my Queen I haven’t slept those nights when I think of feeding you… every night from the day we met, I haven’t slept properly… as soon as I close my eyes, I feel you in my arms & then in the happiness of having you in my arms close to me, I open my eyes to see you & you are not there… I start crying… & I can’t sleep…
</p>
<br>
<p>
my Queen you mean everything to me now… I don’t know if you think that he’s crying how can he cry on this, my Queen I’m not weak, but your absence I can’t bear it, you are my power my strength… you’re my everything yar… I promise the day you will be with me, I will stand with you no matter what happens… I support you… my Queen we understand each other so well, we listen to each other… I can’t wait to spend my life with you… because there is no place, I would rather be… You’re stuck with me… you better remember that… I love us… 
</p>
<br>
<p>
I know we make the best prefect couples… people are already jealous of us being together… my Queen my lovely Wife, I just wanted you to know I love everything about you… I love the way you laugh, I love the way you talk & express yourself… small things about you make you so lovable… it can be the gesture of your hands the expression on your face… I want to make it my life’s purpose to keep you happy & us together…
