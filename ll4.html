<h3 style="color:red;"> Dear Aishwarya </h3>
  <p>
I just wanna tell you how much mean to me, I cannot describe it because words are failing me right now, but know I cherish you & I will foreva love you... my Queen I love you sooo much that no words can describe my feelings for you… yes it has been 4 months since we are together, but it feels a lot more… I’m sooooo attached to my Queen, that without listening to your voice, my day is incomplete, my day starts when I hear your beautiful voice…
</p>
<br>
<p>
As I woke up this morning, I was filled with your thoughts, I was missing you a lot, I wanted to feel you hug you tightly & keep on telling you “I love you my Queen”… There was this feeling of inexplicable joi in my heart & I knew it at that moment that I needed to tell you just how much I love you. Forgive me, for I’m not a writer, & may not know the best way & the best words to use, but all I do know is that I love you & that I want to spend the rest of my life with you my Queen. You have given me so much joi & unconditional love that I’m quite sure that I’m the luckiest man alive on the face of this earth. So, all I ask of you is to continue loving me, stay happy & I promise you that I shall do everything to take care of you & love you till the end of time… 
</p>
<br>
<p>
I look back on us, & I know for a fact that you were & you are all that I need to truly feel complete… you have filled my life with so many colors that it’s hard to keep track of all the jois you bring, sometimes when you’re not aware of it, I look at you & think to myself “How lucky could I possible be, to have her?” I don’t say this to flatter you, but I say this to let you know that love is something that means you now, & it will always be so.

  <p>
While I lay here waiting to hear from you, I can’t’ help thinking about what my life has become when you became my life not a part of it… Waiting & wanting you has been the focus of my thoughts these days, knowing that one day, all that I have envisioned of us being together, will finally happen…
</p>
<br>
<p>
You gimme reason to wake up this morning & smile… Just smile for no particular reason except the fact that you’re here. As days go by I feel myself growing closer & closer & my heart suddenly coming out of its shy spot & wanting to feel what it feels to be loved… I don’t eva want to lose this feeling, I don’t eva want to lose you my Queen..
</p>
<br>
<p>
When I hear you’re voice, it’s like a feeling I don’t want to leave; you give me comfort & joi.. .the sound of your voice is like my favorite song. I can listen to it all night… Yet still as I continue to lay here & think about everything you’re to me…
You are in my mind now & I want to write it down. My heart is with you, but you’re also in my heart, but I want you close to me, so now you in my mind… When I look at your picture I feel my heart beats faster & I cannot describe the happiness that invades me.
</p>
<br>
<p>
When I feel you gaze upon my eyes & your hand holding mine, a wonderful feeling wraps me up, your love has turned my life around & now you have become my life… I know tomorrow will be better than today because of you… everyday I love a bit more…
You are my owner now, when we hold & hug each other I would say there is nothing better…

I am who I am because of you my Queen, & there is no one else I want to be with. You have taught me so much about this world, even through the times when darkness covered my world, you were always there for me… you’re my light… I apologize, I sincerely apologize for all the fights we had so far, they were only because I don’t wanna lose you… I trust you & I know you ain’t going anywhere, but I get afraid when I see you close to someone else, that’s why we get into fights, I know its my fault, but what should I do, I can’t see you with others… now that I have told mumma there is no chance of me leaving… I wanna marry youuuu… Sorry for my insecurities but I promise I will neva restrict you from anything, my Queen you can do anything you want, I’m there with you, I’ll keep you safe & happy… I promise my Queen…
