<h3 style="color:red;"> Dear Aishwarya </h3>
  <p>You are my beautiful world, you are my life and soul and always will be mine, you are my first love and last, you are my future, my present, loving you is all I will ever do, because I need you in my life. Without your love I know I would have neva found my way, I love you.
</p>
<br>
<p>
To express the love that I feel for you is quite difficult in words are not enough to describe what can only be felt. Loving you has been a journey of transformation for me, for you changed me & molded me into a strong and confident person that I am today. You’re the reason why I wake every morning with a smile on my face. You bring the joi from within into my life & the fact that I have you makes life worth living. I love you and always will.
</p>
<br>
<p>
We both know we have a very special relation- without ever needing to say so – how in love we are. But now I want to say you are very precious to me. I love to be close to you. You are more beautiful than sunshine, more precious than anything. You are sweetest & loveliest. You are exquisite & delightful, special & unique. And what’s most astounding of all, you want to be with me. 
</p>
<p>
I remember the first time we talked. It was one of the best moments of my life. The time we spent together was so enchanting that each moment without you feel like a punishment to me. I only know how difficult it was for me to restrain myself from rushing to you & to conc on my work. Sometimes when I couldn’t bear your absence, I would just call you up.

  <div class="column1 right1">
  <p>We slowly developed a deep love, & eventually we both knew it. It was so beautiful a feeling. I am madly in love with you, my darling. </p>
<br>
<p>
My life is beautiful because of you my love.
You showed me the meaning of love not with your words but with your care.
I know your shy nature doesn’t let you open up to me;
But your eyes speak up the love you have for me. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
In life there are certain things that words cannot describe. The feeling I have when I talk to you, when I think about you, and when I dream about you, is amazing. I've never felt like this, before in my life. My love for you has grown so much over the past couple of months. I would have never imagined that we would be where we are today. I don't think that our love will ever fade or wither. I'll always be there for you. My life is perfect with you in it. Thank you, my love for making my life so beautiful.
</p>
<p>
I do not know how to express or analyse the conflicting emotions that have surged like a
storm through my heart all night long. I only know that first and foremost in all my thoughts has been the glorious confirmation you gave me last night - without effort, unconsciously, as of course of all I have ever thought of your mind and heart.

  <p>You have the greatest soul, the noblest nature, the sweetest, most loving heart I have ever known, and my love, my reverence, my admiration for you, you have increased in one evening as I should have thought only a lifetime of intimate, loving association could have increased them. You are more wonderful and lovely in my eyes than you ever were before; and my pride and joy and gratitude that you should love me with such a perfect love are beyond all expression, except in some great poem which I cannot write.
</p>
<p>
I never knew the meaning of true love till the day I met you and having you as my sweetheart is like a dream come true for me. I become a little weak when it comes to speak my feelings in front of you, so I have thought to pen down my feelings, as I did not want to miss a chance to let you know that you are an true companion, my best friend and my soulmate. I just wish to tell you that I love you till eternity. I am madly in love with your gentle smile, the spark in your eyes, your warm touch and essence of the bond that we share. I cherish each and every moment spent with you. With you in my life I feel to be the luckiest person on this earth. You really mean the world to me. I love you.
</p>
<p>
 I Love You</p><p>
I love you for being my Queen,</p><p>
I love you for being my partner and my friend.</p><p>
I love you for the caring and joy that you</p><p>
share without end.</p><p>
I love you for the warm tender touch and</p><p>
the things you do for me.</p>

<br>
<p>
I thought of you. I'm always thinking of you. You mean the
world and more to me. I had never felt true
happiness until I met you, and I can never
thank you enough for making me feel this way.
I'll always be there for you, and I'll always
I had the most amazing time in video
with you, and I care waits to see what the future has in store for us. I have a feeling
it's going to be incredible.

<p>
I apologize for getting jealous & angry sometimes. I want you to spent all your time with me, & want you to be the most comfortable with me, so I get jealous sometimes, I apologize for the same. 
Thank you for everything you do for me, for your constant support, & for always being there for me. I’m so glad to have you in my life!
